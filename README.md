**School Attendance Calculator**

This project is a simple web tool designed to help teachers manage student attendance records without the stress of manual math. I built this to solve a common problem in our daily school life where tallying weekly and term figures by hand takes too much time.

This calculator helps the school team stay organized by providing two main tools in one place.

**Weekly Attendance**: This section allows you to enter daily numbers for Monday through Friday. It automatically handles the weighted math where daily presence is doubled to account for morning and afternoon sessions. It then gives you a final percentage based on your total students and the number of days the school was open.

**Closing Attendance:** This section helps with term reporting. You enter the total attendance for the full term and the number of male and female students. The tool then calculates the average attendance for the term and provides specific metrics for male and female attendance ratios.

**How to use this tool**
Visit the live link in your browser.
Choose between the Weekly or Closing tab at the top.
Type your numbers into the empty boxes.
The results will update on the right side of the screen as you type.
Use the reset button at the bottom if you want to start a new calculation.
